###### Nebula
= A huge cloud of **gas and dust**from which new stars and galaxies form

###### St. Augustine
stated that the universe was created by God from **out of nothing.**

•	It will lead to **another big bang** if Gravity will pull the galaxies back toward the center of the universe; matter and energy will come closer and closer to the central area.

• Not all planets spin in the same direction as they orbit.

###### • Solar system
came From the **disk of gas** and dust that surrounded the sun as it condensed from the interstellar medium.

###### • Nebula theory
is a special event explaining how the planets were formed.

###### • Igneous rocks
= **can change** into either **sedimentary rocks** or metamorphic rocks due to enormous heat and pressure.

###### • accretion
is what you call the process of sticking **together solid** particles?	.

###### • mineral
is An inorganic, naturally occurring, crystalline substance presented by a specific chemical formula.

###### • asthenosphere 
is layer of the **upper mantle** that responds to stress by deforming and flowing slowly rather than by fracturing.

the **possible outcome** of the crystallization of molten rocks beneath the Earth’s surface is It may produce **intrusive igneous rock**
###### • Clasts 
The broken fragments of solids 

• true about igneous rocks info.

It can be formed below or above the surface of the Earth.

• It varies in texture, chemical composition, crystalline structure, the endency to fracture and the presence and absence of layering.

• It is classified in terms of its mineral composition and the size of constituent minerals.

###### • The core
is contains **one-third** of the Earth’s mass.

###### • Outer core
is not solid with evidence **P waves pass** through it, S waves cannot pass through it

• According to **Alfred Wegener’s** Continental Drift Theory, **continents have shifted.** 

###### • Evidences:
Widely separated continents with similar reptile and plant fossils, Reconstruction of rocks using paleomagnetism data, Tropical forest climates existed on widely separated continents

• Sample of oxidation: A stone has a presence of **yellowish rusty stains** on its surface. 

###### • The lithosphere
floats on top of the **asthenosphere**

###### • exogenic process
is a **relief-reducing** processes, Occurs at or near the Earth’s surface, Lessens the topographical difference among land features

###### • Freeze-thaw 
It freezes
###### Avalanche 
flows rapidly

###### Lahar 
Ashes 	
###### Divergent 
is tensional

###### Convergent
is compressional

###### Transform 
is shearing

###### Faulting 
is too rigid to bend when stressed while folding is bendable.

Rock materials located in the asthenosphere behave flows and folds when acted upon by compressional forces

###### Earthquakes 
sudden release, said to be evidence of present-day tectonics.

###### Indian ocean 
is do about 90% of the **world's major** earthquakes occur

###### igneous intrusions 
plutonism

 
•	The theory explaining that the Earth's outer shell is composed of many moving segments is called tectonic plate	

•	Alfred Wegener = A German scientist who proposed the theory of continental drift despite publishing a large body of compelling fossil and rock evidence for his theory and was rejected by most other scientists.

•	Which is NOT true about the continental-to- continental plate convergence movement?
There is no formation of volcanoes.
It causes the formation of mountains such as the Himalayan Mountains and the Appalachian Mountains.
There is an occurrence of the subduction process.
 

###### East African rift
is famous because of
continental-continental divergent plate boundary.
