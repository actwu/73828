1. **Menu Management System (MMS):**
   - **Location:** Embodied in the `menuItem` function and its related logic.
   - **Function:** Manages the creation, layout, and display of menu items. It handles the formatting and printing of individual menu items.

2. **Point of Sale (POS):**
   - **Location:** Primarily managed within the `inputScreen` function.
   - **Function:** Handles user interactions for item selection, validates user choices against the available menu, and ensures the budget suffices for the purchase. It manages the transactional aspect of the user's interaction.

3. **Inventory Management System (IMS):**
   - **Location:** Functions like `readFile` and `writeFile` operating on an inventory file (`stocks.txt`) are indicative of IMS functionalities.
   - **Function:** Manages file operations related to inventory, such as reading and writing to an inventory file. It handles the storage and retrieval of inventory-related information.

4. **Payment Payroll System (PPS):**
   - **Location:** Predominantly within the `inputScreen` function.
   - **Function:** Manages the budget scanning process (user's available funds) and the payment processing logic. It validates the user's budget against selected items and processes the payment based on available funds.

### **Menu Management System (MMS)**

#### **Code: `menuItem` function**

```c
typedef struct {
    int number;
    int price;
    const char* maine;
    const char* add1;
    const char* add2;
    const char* add3;
} menuList;

menuList menuItems[99]; 

void menuItem(int number, int price, const char* maine, const char* add1, const char* add2, const char* add3) {
    menuItems[number - 1].number = number;
    menuItems[number - 1].price = price;
    menuItems[number - 1].maine = maine;
    menuItems[number - 1].add1 = add1;
    menuItems[number - 1].add2 = add2;
    menuItems[number - 1].add3 = add3;

    // Print menu item details
    printf("\n\n %d. %10s \t\t\t P%d", number, maine, price);
    if (strcmp(add1, "n") != 0) {printf("\n\t- %s", add1);}
    if (strcmp(add2, "n") != 0) {printf("\n\t- %s", add2);}
    if (strcmp(add3, "n") != 0) {printf("\n\t- %s", add3);}
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `menuItem` function defines a structure `menuList` to store menu item details.
- An array `menuItems` is created to hold menu items with a limit of 99 items.
- `menuItem` function allows adding menu items to the `menuItems` array.
- It assigns the provided parameters to the respective fields of the menu item.
- Displays the menu item's number, name, and price along with additional details if available.

#### **Feature:**
- Enables adding and displaying menu items with details.
- Can handle up to 99 menu items.

#### **Limitation:**
- Limited to a predefined number of menu items (99).
- Cannot dynamically resize or update menu items during runtime.

### **Point of Sale (POS)**

#### **Code: `inputScreen` function**

```c
void inputScreen() {
    int budget = 0;
    int price = 0;
    int choice = -1;

    printf("\n\nState Your Budget: ");
    scanf("%d", &budget);
  
    // Loop for user interaction
    do {
        printf("\n\nChoice in number, 0 if done: ");
        scanf("%d", &choice);
        getchar(); // Consume newline character

        // Validating user choice and budget constraints
        if (choice >= 1 && choice <= sizeof(menuItems) / sizeof(menuItems[0])) {
            if ((budget - price) >= menuItems[choice - 1].price) {
                printf("+1 %s and?\n", menuItems[choice - 1].maine);
                price += menuItems[choice - 1].price;
            } else {
                printf("Cannot purchase this item.\n");
            }
        } else if(choice != 0) {
            printf("Choice is not available.\n");
        }
    } while (choice != 0); 

    // Display transaction details
    printf("Total price: P%d\n", price);
    printf("Change: P%d\n", budget - price);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `inputScreen` manages user interaction, budget validation, and transaction processing.
- Declares variables for budget, price, and user choice.
- Takes user budget as input and prompts for item choices.
- Validates the user's choice against available items and budget.
- Calculates the total price and change after the transaction.
- Displays the total price and change to the user.

#### **Feature:**
- Validates user input against available menu items.
- Checks budget constraints before allowing a purchase.
- Calculates and displays the total price and change.

#### **Limitation:**
- Limited error handling beyond budget constraints.
- No user authentication or advanced transactional features.

Sure, here's the continuation:

### **Payment Payroll System (PPS)**

#### **Code: Payment processing logic in `inputScreen` function**

```c
void inputScreen() {
    // ... (previous code)

    do {
        // ... (previous code)

        if (choice >= 1 && choice <= sizeof(menuItems) / sizeof(menuItems[0])) {
            if ((budget - price) >= menuItems[choice - 1].price) {
                printf("+1 %s and?\n", menuItems[choice - 1].maine);
                price += menuItems[choice - 1].price;
            } else {
                printf("Cannot purchase this item.\n");
            }
        } else if(choice != 0) {
            printf("Choice is not available.\n");
        }
    } while (choice != 0); 

    // Display transaction details
    printf("Total price: P%d\n", price);
    printf("Change: P%d\n", budget - price);
}
```

**Explanation:**
- The payment processing logic is integrated within the `inputScreen` function.
- It determines if the user's budget can cover the cost of the selected item.
- If the budget is sufficient, the item's price is added to the transaction total.
- If the budget cannot cover the item's price, a message indicates the inability to purchase the item.

#### **Feature:**
- Incorporates budget validation to ensure the affordability of selected items.
- Provides immediate feedback if an item exceeds the user's budget.

#### **Limitation:**
- Lacks sophisticated payment options such as different payment methods or tracking payment history.
- Limited to checking budget constraints only for individual transactions.

---

### **Inventory Management System (IMS)**

#### **Code: `readFile` and `writeFile` functions**

```c
void readFile(const char *stocksFile) {
    // ... (file handling code)
}

void writeFile(const char *stocksFile) {
    // ... (file handling code)
}
```

**Explanation:**
- `readFile` reads content from the specified file (`stocksFile`) and displays it.
- `writeFile` appends user input to the specified file (`stocksFile`) until termination input ("#done") is received.

#### **Feature:**
- `readFile` allows viewing the content of a specified file (presumably an inventory file).
- `writeFile` enables appending new content to the same file interactively.

#### **Limitation:**
- Limited to basic read/write operations; doesn't implement complex inventory management functions like updates or deletions.
- No data validation or error handling for file operations.
